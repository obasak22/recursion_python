# recursion_python
An exercise about recursion made by me in Python.

I used a recursive approach that parses the string, identifies the sin and cos components, and then evaluates them at the given point x. The recursion helps us handle nested expressions where one trigonometric function serves as the argument of another. My code can compute the value of the function at a specific x value using recursion from a string that represents a trigonometric function composed of sin(x) and cos(x), potentially nested and multiplied.
